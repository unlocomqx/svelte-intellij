This project is run by one person, because I want Svelte to succeed. Please, leave a star and spread the word.

<h2>Contributing</h2>

Contributions are very much welcome! 

IntelliJ Platform runs on JVM, so this can seem like a huge limitation, but don't worry. Kotlin looks a lot like TypeScript. Bigger issue is scarce documentation for their API. I'll write a few words describing it some day.

If you don't know how to write IntelliJ plugins, please report what could be improved. IntelliJ has a huge feature set, I personally don't use everything it has to offer.
